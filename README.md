# Caesar Cipher

## Description
This was written to complete an assignment for The Odin Project.  
The goal of the assignment was to solidify my knowledge of ruby and my understanding of Ruby.  
All this project does is to implement a caesar cipher function. It uses Rspec to test the different cases to make sure that the function runs properly.
